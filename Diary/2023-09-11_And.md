Sometimes when binding, you want to reuse the return value from an earlier bind. 
Stupid example:

Load a customer from the database, load a customers orders from the database, and then update the customers ordersCount by looking at how many orders the customer has. This means we need information from two repositories, to be able to update the customer.
UpdateDenormalizedUserCount could look lie this:


```csharp
Result<Unit> result = CustomerRepository.Load(customerId)
    .Bind(customer => OrderRepository.Query(x => x.CustomerId == customerId))
    .Bind(orders => customer.SetOrderCount(orders.Count())); // won't compile, customer is not available here!!!!
```

To fix this, you can nest the Binds, so that the customer reference is available in the next bind, like this:

```csharp
Result<Unit> result = CustomerRepository.Load(customerId)
    .Bind(customer => OrderRepository.Query(x => x.CustomerId == customerId)
        .Bind(orders => customer.SetOrderCount(orders.Count()))); // Binds directly on the returned Result of the previous Bind.
```

"And", can do this for you


```csharp
Result<Unit> result = CustomerRepository.Load(customerId)
    .And(customer => OrderRepository.Query(x => x.CustomerId == customerId)) // Combines the previous result with the new result, and returns a Result with a tuple-value containing both customer and orders.
    .Bind((customer, orders) => customer.SetOrderCount(orders.Count())); 
```
